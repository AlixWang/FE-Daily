Hello readers let's talk about poems!
Poetry is a special kink of writing, if ordinary writing is like talking, then poetry is like singing. 

Poetry is A way of making art with language.

Poems can express huge ideals or feelings that can be of a thunderm or rythem of language. or they can be goose little jokes. it's like any other kind of rythyme poems can be about erverything or they can be nothing at all. they can be funny or sad or sweet, they can rhyme they can not much rhyme. 

And all of that is in my opinion absolutely wonderful, I think of some poems as can denste ideals they can ten a lot of ideals small amounts of taxt. so ervey word matter a lot. does it xx poems represent ideals.
